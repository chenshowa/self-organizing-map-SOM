# Self-organizing-map(SOM) tutorial
This is a simple example for implementing self-organizing-map â€“ Kohonen map 

---

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
# Getting Started
- Install [PyMVPA](http://www.pymvpa.org/index.html)
- Install [PyMVPA for windows](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)

> This is a demonstration of how to map high-dimensional data like below image into a two-dimensional representation.
